# Research HPC Rollout


> Standard: PSDC-DOC-001
> Document type: roadmap
> Status: Draft for owner review; sourced from accepted decisions, open gaps listed
> Owner: PSDC Roadmap Working Group
> Accountable maintainer: RedjiJB until delegation
> Last reviewed: 2026-09-11
> Governing decisions: Applicable ADRs and repository governance
> Domain: roadmap

> **Decision status:** Statements directly traced to accepted ADRs, the decision register, or
> the constitutional architecture restate existing authority. Any new rule identifier, ordering
> or uncited constraint introduced by this draft is a proposal for owner review, not a binding
> decision. It becomes normative only when the accountable owner accepts it through the decision
> register, an ADR, or a released contract. The Gaps section remains explicitly open.

## Purpose and outcome

This document records what the architecture decides about research and high-performance computing and, mainly, what it leaves open. It is deliberately short: few HPC decisions have been made. An implementation conforms only when it satisfies this document, the linked ADRs and the common [Specification Completeness Standard](../architecture/Specification-Completeness-Standard.md).

## Scope

- **In scope:** behaviour, interfaces, dependencies, data, security, deployment
  boundaries, capacity, failure handling, observability, validation, and lifecycle
  requirements for Research HPC Rollout.
- **Out of scope:** institution-specific hostnames, credentials, physical capacity,
  named operators, and legal approvals. Those values belong in signed institution
  deployment manifests and cannot redefine the common contract.
- **Authority:** the owning domain may make compatible implementation choices.
  Contract-breaking or cross-domain changes require an ADR and migration plan.

## Normative requirements

- **ROAD-RHR-001:** The Research HPC Rollout capability SHALL provide dependency-ordered delivery with explicit outcomes, entry and exit criteria, risks, owners, and evidence.
- The capability SHALL have a versioned configuration schema, explicit safe
  defaults, validation before activation, and a reversible change procedure.
- User-visible and administrative behaviour SHALL be accessible, explainable,
  auditable, and bounded by institution policy and user authority.
- An implementation SHALL expose only the minimum capability required by its
  callers and SHALL reject unknown, unauthorized, malformed, expired, or
  unsupported requests with stable machine-readable errors.
- Institution deployments SHALL be independently operable and SHALL remain
  compatible with the common contract and conformance suite.

## Subject-specific specification

### What is decided

- **Slurm is a backend, not a common contract.** VS-04 is a Slurm HPC job: a tightly coupled job reaches an eligible HPC partition without being misrouted to the task fabric. The path is HPC manifest, topology and network classification, reservation or offer, Slurm adapter, job and accounting, receipt and settlement ([Vertical Slice Completion Plan](Vertical-Slice-Completion-Plan.md)). It belongs to wave C, after VS-01.
- **HPC networking.** Separate management, compute and storage paths, topology-aware partitions and minimal compute-node egress (NET-012). RDMA or other specialized fabric is an optional managed profile only after workload evidence, not baseline (NET-013, HW-005).
- **Distributed inference** waits for independent replicas, topology and failure tests (Commons Compute Fabric-014). The workload classes already include an HPC MPI class ([workload contract](../../contracts/compute/workload-manifest.schema.json)).
- **Research workflow story.** A researcher defines a reproducible container and data manifest; the compute fabric schedules it, media stores outputs, AI supports analysis, and the platform records lineage, usage, consent, retention and publication policy ([Cross-Pollination](../architecture/Cross-Pollination-and-Shared-Capabilities.md)).
- **Cross-institution research (proposed phase 9 scenario, not an approved capability).** The constitutional model allows an approved data and model manifest with a bounded workload envelope to run on an approved peer without sharing the researcher's directory, private source data or credentials, with results returned as signed, content-addressed artifacts. No contract or decision yet establishes that behavior. It is gated by the federation contract, data-transfer authority, consent, residency, export-control review where applicable, result validation, peer suspension and exit, and dispute handling.

### Rules

- **HPC-1:** An HPC job is classified before placement and never routed to opportunistic task capacity.
- **HPC-2:** Research data keeps its classification and residency; federation never widens either.
- **HPC-3:** Accounting records resource classes, not content.

### Gaps

There is no research-access policy (the research access document is a stub), no HPC partition inventory, no scheduler or MPI choice beyond the Slurm backend kind, no quota policy for research versus teaching, and no owner. Treat this rollout as unscheduled until a research sponsor exists.

## Interfaces, APIs, events, and contracts

See the [Ecosystem Dependency Contract](../architecture/Ecosystem-Dependency-Contract.md); local extensions remain normative.

## Dependencies and ownership boundaries

Inherits [baseline ownership controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#ownership-and-dependency-boundaries).

## Data, state, residency, and retention

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Security, privacy, safety, and compliance

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Deployment, environments, and configuration

Inherits [baseline deployment controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#deployment-and-configuration).

## Capacity, scaling, cost, and sustainability

Inherits [baseline capacity controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#capacity-and-overload).

## Failure, recovery, and compatibility

Inherits [baseline reliability controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#reliability-and-compatibility); local extensions remain normative.

## Observability, testing, and operational readiness

Inherits [baseline evidence controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence).

## Standards and implementation strategy

Follows adopt, extend, fork, then build ([ADR-0001](../architecture/architecture-decision-records/ADR-0001-standards-first-buy-borrow-build.md)).

## Settled architecture constraints

The accepted constraints are the ADRs listed below and the precedence rules in [Architecture Authority and Precedence](../architecture/Architecture-Authority-and-Precedence.md).

## Decision traceability

- ADR-0001: Standards-First / Buy-Borrow-Build
- ADR-0005: Standard Platform Primitives
- ADR-0012: Tenant-Neutral Post-Secondary Digital Commons
- ADR-0013: Institution-First Federation Locality
- ADR-0016: Accepted Project Defaults
- ADR-0017: OpenTofu Default Infrastructure-as-Code Toolchain

## Acceptance criteria

Inherits [baseline acceptance gates](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence); every local requirement MUST also pass.

## Outcome

The roadmap outcome is a usable vertical slice with stable contracts, operational ownership, and evidence sufficient to start the next phase.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are phase gates, not suggestions. Each dependency has an owner, compatibility expectation, and fallback; unmet dependencies keep work in the current phase.

## Phase

Each numbered phase defines the capability and evidence to produce. Phase work MUST preserve the documented order unless a superseding ADR records the change.

## Exit criteria

Exit criteria include passing tests, security/privacy review, operator runbook, rollback rehearsal, and accountable ownership for the next dependency.

## Risk

Risks include lock-in, authority escalation, privacy leakage, upstream drift, capacity, and contract instability. Mitigations and residual risk are recorded with the phase.

## Evidence

Evidence includes contract tests, threat/privacy reviews, provenance/SBOM, capacity/failure results, runbooks, approvals, and a signed phase decision.
