## Purpose and outcome

This document describes the institution pilot: a time-bounded, sponsored trial with approved participants and only the data and integrations explicitly accepted. It corresponds to phase 6 in [Master Roadmap](Master-Roadmap.md). An implementation conforms only when it satisfies this document, the linked ADRs and the common [Specification Completeness Standard](../architecture/Specification-Completeness-Standard.md).

## Scope

- **In scope:** behaviour, interfaces, dependencies, data, security, deployment
  boundaries, capacity, failure handling, observability, validation, and lifecycle
  requirements for Pilot.
- **Out of scope:** institution-specific hostnames, credentials, physical capacity,
  named operators, and legal approvals. Those values belong in signed institution
  deployment manifests and cannot redefine the common contract.
- **Authority:** the owning domain may make compatible implementation choices.
  Contract-breaking or cross-domain changes require an ADR and migration plan.

## Normative requirements

- **ROAD-PILOT-001:** The Pilot capability SHALL provide dependency-ordered delivery with explicit outcomes, entry and exit criteria, risks, owners, and evidence.
- The capability SHALL have a versioned configuration schema, explicit safe
  defaults, validation before activation, and a reversible change procedure.
- User-visible and administrative behaviour SHALL be accessible, explainable,
  auditable, and bounded by institution policy and user authority.
- An implementation SHALL expose only the minimum capability required by its
  callers and SHALL reject unknown, unauthorized, malformed, expired, or
  unsupported requests with stable machine-readable errors.
- Institution deployments SHALL be independently operable and SHALL remain
  compatible with the common contract and conformance suite.

## Subject-specific specification

### Objective

Run a limited cohort on approved infrastructure, using institutional identity, and measure outcomes and harm before any expansion. The accepted default is a small opt-in club or research cohort (ROAD-005); the cohort size and population are decided by the sponsor, privacy and security reviewers, and are not set here.

### Entry conditions

- An institution sponsor and a pilot service owner are named.
- An institution unit owns production identity, infrastructure, secrets and continuity (GOV-003).
- A named data steward exists for each domain whose real data the pilot will use: identity, academic, media, social or telemetry (GOV-011).
- Security, privacy and accessibility reviews approve the bounded scope.
- Institutional identity and integration owners authorize test access.
- Pilot success, stop and rollback criteria are signed and include every global stop condition in [Master Roadmap](Master-Roadmap.md).
- Support and incident coverage exists, with a named incident commander and privacy and legal paths (SEC-008).

### Required work

Institutional OIDC and role mapping with lifecycle tests (join, role change, withdrawal, emergency revocation); learning-system integration only through supported interfaces and approved scopes; a signed deployment manifest and compatibility lock; pilot infrastructure in approved zones; a data inventory, privacy assessment and retention and deletion tests; penetration, abuse, capacity, backup and recovery testing; service-desk intake and escalation; a monitored cohort with success and harm indicators; and an explicit evidence review to close or extend.

### Rules

- **PIL-1:** The pilot uses data classes explicitly accepted for it; protected student data is excluded until its controls are proven.
- **PIL-1a:** If the service authority or a required data steward is absent, the pilot is synthetic-only. A synthetic-only pilot does not become a real-participant pilot without a new entry review.
- **PIL-2:** A named human body can pause unsafe or unsustainable work (ROAD-012); a missed stop criterion or a global stop condition triggers suspension and rollback or remediation, not silent expansion.
- **PIL-3:** Pilot data is exportable and deletable under policy.
- **PIL-4:** Exit evidence and decision owners are in the phase 6 row of [Exit Criteria by Phase](Exit-Criteria-by-Phase.md).

### Gaps

No sponsor, cohort, schedule, success measure or stop threshold is set; those are decisions for the institution. The register lists the pilot population and size as pending authority (decision queue item 3).

## Interfaces, APIs, events, and contracts

See the [Ecosystem Dependency Contract](../architecture/Ecosystem-Dependency-Contract.md); local extensions remain normative.

## Dependencies and ownership boundaries

Inherits [baseline ownership controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#ownership-and-dependency-boundaries).

## Data, state, residency, and retention

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Security, privacy, safety, and compliance

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Deployment, environments, and configuration

Inherits [baseline deployment controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#deployment-and-configuration).

## Capacity, scaling, cost, and sustainability

Inherits [baseline capacity controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#capacity-and-overload).

## Failure, recovery, and compatibility

Inherits [baseline reliability controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#reliability-and-compatibility); local extensions remain normative.

## Observability, testing, and operational readiness

Inherits [baseline evidence controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence).

## Standards and implementation strategy

Follows adopt, extend, fork, then build ([ADR-0001](../architecture/architecture-decision-records/ADR-0001-standards-first-buy-borrow-build.md)).

## Settled architecture constraints

The accepted constraints are the ADRs listed below and the precedence rules in [Architecture Authority and Precedence](../architecture/Architecture-Authority-and-Precedence.md).

## Decision traceability

- ADR-0001: Standards-First / Buy-Borrow-Build
- ADR-0005: Standard Platform Primitives
- ADR-0012: Tenant-Neutral Post-Secondary Digital Commons
- ADR-0013: Institution-First Federation Locality
- ADR-0016: Accepted Project Defaults
- ADR-0017: OpenTofu Default Infrastructure-as-Code Toolchain

## Acceptance criteria

Inherits [baseline acceptance gates](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence); every local requirement MUST also pass.

## Outcome

The roadmap outcome is a usable vertical slice with stable contracts, operational ownership, and evidence sufficient to start the next phase.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are phase gates, not suggestions. Each dependency has an owner, compatibility expectation, and fallback; unmet dependencies keep work in the current phase.

## Phase

Each numbered phase defines the capability and evidence to produce. Phase work MUST preserve the documented order unless a superseding ADR records the change.

## Exit criteria

Exit criteria include passing tests, security/privacy review, operator runbook, rollback rehearsal, and accountable ownership for the next dependency.

## Risk

Risks include lock-in, authority escalation, privacy leakage, upstream drift, capacity, and contract instability. Mitigations and residual risk are recorded with the phase.

## Evidence

Evidence includes contract tests, threat/privacy reviews, provenance/SBOM, capacity/failure results, runbooks, approvals, and a signed phase decision.
