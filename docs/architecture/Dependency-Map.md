## Purpose and outcome

This document is the short form of the dependency picture: the direction of allowed use, the dependency classes, and the cycles that are forbidden. The full runtime matrix, with the required failure behavior for each pair, is the [Ecosystem Dependency Contract](Ecosystem-Dependency-Contract.md). An implementation conforms only when it satisfies this document, the linked ADRs and the common [Specification Completeness Standard](../architecture/Specification-Completeness-Standard.md).

## Scope

- **In scope:** behaviour, interfaces, dependencies, data, security, deployment
  boundaries, capacity, failure handling, observability, validation, and lifecycle
  requirements for Dependency Map.
- **Out of scope:** institution-specific hostnames, credentials, physical capacity,
  named operators, and legal approvals. Those values belong in signed institution
  deployment manifests and cannot redefine the common contract.
- **Authority:** the owning domain may make compatible implementation choices.
  Contract-breaking or cross-domain changes require an ADR and migration plan.

## Normative requirements

- **ARCH-DM-001:** The Dependency Map capability SHALL provide coherent system boundaries, portable contracts, explicit trust zones, and institution-first federation.
- The capability SHALL have a versioned configuration schema, explicit safe
  defaults, validation before activation, and a reversible change procedure.
- User-visible and administrative behaviour SHALL be accessible, explainable,
  auditable, and bounded by institution policy and user authority.
- An implementation SHALL expose only the minimum capability required by its
  callers and SHALL reject unknown, unauthorized, malformed, expired, or
  unsupported requests with stable machine-readable errors.
- Institution deployments SHALL be independently operable and SHALL remain
  compatible with the common contract and conformance suite.

## Subject-specific specification

> **Decision status:** Statements directly traced to accepted ADRs, the decision register, or
> constitutional architecture restate existing authority. Any new rule identifier or uncited
> implementation constraint introduced by this draft is a proposal for owner review, not a
> binding decision. It becomes normative only when the accountable owner accepts it through the
> decision register, an ADR, or a released contract. The Gaps section remains explicitly open.

### Direction of allowed use

```text
open standards and shared contracts
              |
        Commons Cloud
        /     |      \
   Compute   AI   Media/Spatial
        \     |      /
         Social Fabric
              |
   Web, desktop, mobile clients
```

Arrows mean allowed service consumption, never shared database access. Commons Cloud has no runtime dependency on product systems. Compute, AI and Media stay independently deployable. The Social fabric operates text-only when AI or Media is unavailable.

### Dependency classes

Foundation (required to start or authenticate), capability (required only for a named feature), asynchronous (work can queue), development, external adapter, and federation peer.

### Forbidden cycles

- Cloud cannot require AI, Media, Social or Compute in order to authenticate, route, observe or recover core services.
- Compute scheduling cannot call AI to make mandatory placement decisions.
- AI policy cannot require Social or Media availability.
- Media storage cannot require a Social database.
- Social identity cannot silently become institutional identity.
- A federation peer cannot become a local identity, policy, secrets, LMS, database or infrastructure-state authority.
- A client cannot call model runtimes, directories, LMS databases, social databases, worker agents or storage backends directly.

### Contract ownership

The producer owns availability and compatibility of its contract. The consumer owns timeouts, retries, circuit breaking, fallback, queues and user-visible degradation. Both own contract tests and incident communication.

### Gaps

Dependency-level SLOs and outage drills are not defined; the outage matrix document is a stub ([Dependency Outage Matrix](../reliability/Dependency-Outage-Matrix.md)).

## Interfaces, APIs, events, and contracts

See the [Ecosystem Dependency Contract](../architecture/Ecosystem-Dependency-Contract.md); local extensions remain normative.

## Dependencies and ownership boundaries

Inherits [baseline ownership controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#ownership-and-dependency-boundaries).

## Data, state, residency, and retention

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Security, privacy, safety, and compliance

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Deployment, environments, and configuration

Inherits [baseline deployment controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#deployment-and-configuration).

## Capacity, scaling, cost, and sustainability

Inherits [baseline capacity controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#capacity-and-overload).

## Failure, recovery, and compatibility

Inherits [baseline reliability controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#reliability-and-compatibility); local extensions remain normative.

## Observability, testing, and operational readiness

Inherits [baseline evidence controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence).

## Standards and implementation strategy

Follows adopt, extend, fork, then build ([ADR-0001](../architecture/architecture-decision-records/ADR-0001-standards-first-buy-borrow-build.md)).

## Settled architecture constraints

The accepted constraints are the ADRs listed below and the precedence rules in [Architecture Authority and Precedence](../architecture/Architecture-Authority-and-Precedence.md).

## Decision traceability

- ADR-0001: Standards-First / Buy-Borrow-Build
- ADR-0005: Standard Platform Primitives
- ADR-0012: Tenant-Neutral Post-Secondary Digital Commons
- ADR-0013: Institution-First Federation Locality
- ADR-0016: Accepted Project Defaults
- ADR-0017: OpenTofu Default Infrastructure-as-Code Toolchain

## Acceptance criteria

Inherits [baseline acceptance gates](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence); every local requirement MUST also pass.
