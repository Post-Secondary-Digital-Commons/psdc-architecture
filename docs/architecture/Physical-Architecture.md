## Purpose and outcome

This document records the physical decisions that have been accepted and, plainly, those that have not. It describes defaults for an eventual build; there is no hardware inventory yet. An implementation conforms only when it satisfies this document, the linked ADRs and the common [Specification Completeness Standard](../architecture/Specification-Completeness-Standard.md).

## Scope

- **In scope:** behaviour, interfaces, dependencies, data, security, deployment
  boundaries, capacity, failure handling, observability, validation, and lifecycle
  requirements for Physical Architecture.
- **Out of scope:** institution-specific hostnames, credentials, physical capacity,
  named operators, and legal approvals. Those values belong in signed institution
  deployment manifests and cannot redefine the common contract.
- **Authority:** the owning domain may make compatible implementation choices.
  Contract-breaking or cross-domain changes require an ADR and migration plan.

## Normative requirements

- **ARCH-PA-001:** The Physical Architecture capability SHALL provide coherent system boundaries, portable contracts, explicit trust zones, and institution-first federation.
- The capability SHALL have a versioned configuration schema, explicit safe
  defaults, validation before activation, and a reversible change procedure.
- User-visible and administrative behaviour SHALL be accessible, explainable,
  auditable, and bounded by institution policy and user authority.
- An implementation SHALL expose only the minimum capability required by its
  callers and SHALL reject unknown, unauthorized, malformed, expired, or
  unsupported requests with stable machine-readable errors.
- Institution deployments SHALL be independently operable and SHALL remain
  compatible with the common contract and conformance suite.

## Subject-specific specification

> **Decision status:** Statements directly traced to accepted ADRs, the decision register, or
> constitutional architecture restate existing authority. Any new rule identifier or uncited
> implementation constraint introduced by this draft is a proposal for owner review, not a
> binding decision. It becomes normative only when the accountable owner accepts it through the
> decision register, an ADR, or a released contract. The Gaps section remains explicitly open.

### Accepted defaults

| Area | Default | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Host operating system | Debian | CLD-001 |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes first; OpenStack only for demonstrated VM or bare-metal demand | CLD-002 |
| Kubernetes distribution | RKE2 managed production, K3s edge and development | CLD-004 |
| Storage | Ceph, dedicated storage nodes when production begins | CLD-008 |
| Initial hardware | A small dedicated pilot plus explicitly approved test workers | HW-001 |
| Accelerators | Prefer hardware with sustainable open-driver support; a proprietary-driver exception needs justification and an exit path | HW-002, HW-003 |
| Network zones | Separate management, control, production, compute and lab, storage, backup, federation, public edge, observability | NET-003 |
| Lab machines | Outbound-only worker mTLS through a cell gateway; interactive use has priority | NET-004 |
| Lifecycle | Repair, reuse, secure disposal and replacement policy | HW-007 |
| Facilities | A facilities-approved sustained load envelope for power and cooling | HW-006 |

### Rules

- **PHY-1:** Hardware choices record an exit path from vendor lock-in.
- **PHY-2:** Physical placement respects the zone model ([Region and Zone Model](Region-and-Zone-Model.md)).
- **PHY-3:** Pilot hardware belongs to authorized owners; the platform never enrolls a machine without owner authorization and attestation ([Node Enrollment and Attestation](../campus-compute-fabric/Node-Enrollment-and-Attestation.md)).

### Gaps

There is no rack plan, no sizing, no named hardware, no power or cooling figure and no site. The register defers each to named authorities with gates before procurement or deployment.

## Interfaces, APIs, events, and contracts

See the [Ecosystem Dependency Contract](../architecture/Ecosystem-Dependency-Contract.md); local extensions remain normative.

## Dependencies and ownership boundaries

Inherits [baseline ownership controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#ownership-and-dependency-boundaries).

## Data, state, residency, and retention

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Security, privacy, safety, and compliance

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Deployment, environments, and configuration

Inherits [baseline deployment controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#deployment-and-configuration).

## Capacity, scaling, cost, and sustainability

Inherits [baseline capacity controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#capacity-and-overload).

## Failure, recovery, and compatibility

Inherits [baseline reliability controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#reliability-and-compatibility); local extensions remain normative.

## Observability, testing, and operational readiness

Inherits [baseline evidence controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence).

## Standards and implementation strategy

Follows adopt, extend, fork, then build ([ADR-0001](../architecture/architecture-decision-records/ADR-0001-standards-first-buy-borrow-build.md)).

## Settled architecture constraints

The accepted constraints are the ADRs listed below and the precedence rules in [Architecture Authority and Precedence](../architecture/Architecture-Authority-and-Precedence.md).

## Decision traceability

- ADR-0001: Standards-First / Buy-Borrow-Build
- ADR-0005: Standard Platform Primitives
- ADR-0012: Tenant-Neutral Post-Secondary Digital Commons
- ADR-0013: Institution-First Federation Locality
- ADR-0016: Accepted Project Defaults
- ADR-0017: OpenTofu Default Infrastructure-as-Code Toolchain

## Acceptance criteria

Inherits [baseline acceptance gates](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence); every local requirement MUST also pass.
