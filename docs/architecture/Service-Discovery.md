## Purpose and outcome

This document describes how clients, services and peers find each other: DNS names, the service catalog, signed deployment manifests and federation discovery. It records the accepted rules and the missing detail. An implementation conforms only when it satisfies this document, the linked ADRs and the common [Specification Completeness Standard](../architecture/Specification-Completeness-Standard.md).

## Scope

- **In scope:** behaviour, interfaces, dependencies, data, security, deployment
  boundaries, capacity, failure handling, observability, validation, and lifecycle
  requirements for Service Discovery.
- **Out of scope:** institution-specific hostnames, credentials, physical capacity,
  named operators, and legal approvals. Those values belong in signed institution
  deployment manifests and cannot redefine the common contract.
- **Authority:** the owning domain may make compatible implementation choices.
  Contract-breaking or cross-domain changes require an ADR and migration plan.

## Normative requirements

- **ARCH-SD-001:** The Service Discovery capability SHALL provide coherent system boundaries, portable contracts, explicit trust zones, and institution-first federation.
- The capability SHALL have a versioned configuration schema, explicit safe
  defaults, validation before activation, and a reversible change procedure.
- User-visible and administrative behaviour SHALL be accessible, explainable,
  auditable, and bounded by institution policy and user authority.
- An implementation SHALL expose only the minimum capability required by its
  callers and SHALL reject unknown, unauthorized, malformed, expired, or
  unsupported requests with stable machine-readable errors.
- Institution deployments SHALL be independently operable and SHALL remain
  compatible with the common contract and conformance suite.

## Subject-specific specification

> **Decision status:** Statements directly traced to accepted ADRs, the decision register, or
> constitutional architecture restate existing authority. Any new rule identifier or uncited
> implementation constraint introduced by this draft is a proposal for owner review, not a
> binding decision. It becomes normative only when the accountable owner accepts it through the
> decision register, an ADR, or a released contract. The Gaps section remains explicitly open.

### Four discovery paths

1. **Clients find an institution** through a signed deployment manifest covering identity discovery, API origins, enabled capabilities, branding, release channels and support. Clients reject unsigned, expired or institution-mismatched configuration ([Ecosystem Dependency Contract](Ecosystem-Dependency-Contract.md)).
2. **Services find services** by stable names, not addresses: service.environment.institution with local Kubernetes DNS beneath it, under institution-owned split DNS with DNSSEC for public zones (NET-006, NET-007).
3. **Developers find services** through the service catalog (ownership, versions, health, documentation) in Commons Cloud.
4. **Peers find capabilities** through capability descriptions and signed references exchanged under an explicit protocol profile; discovery never requires unrestricted access to sovereign institution data.

### Rules

- **SD-1:** Application and federation contracts bind to stable logical resource IDs and service
  names rather than embedding site addresses. Institution deployment profiles, IPAM, network-path
  controllers and firewall policy MAY contain governed IP prefixes and addresses; those values do
  not become portable common-contract identifiers.
- **SD-2:** A catalog entry is not authorization; a caller still needs an authorization decision.
- **SD-3:** Trust is denied by default and does not spread transitively from one peer to another.
- **SD-4:** Federation peers declare identity, trust anchors, supported contract versions, data and geographic envelope, timeouts, revocation, audit fields, incident contacts and exit behavior.

### Gaps

The catalog schema, the deployment-manifest schema's exact fields and the peer-discovery protocol are specified only by reference here. The deployment manifest contract exists as a candidate ([deployment manifest](../../contracts/deployment/deployment-manifest.schema.json)); the catalog does not.

## Interfaces, APIs, events, and contracts

See the [Ecosystem Dependency Contract](../architecture/Ecosystem-Dependency-Contract.md); local extensions remain normative.

## Dependencies and ownership boundaries

Inherits [baseline ownership controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#ownership-and-dependency-boundaries).

## Data, state, residency, and retention

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Security, privacy, safety, and compliance

Inherits [baseline data controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#security-privacy-and-data); local extensions remain normative.

## Deployment, environments, and configuration

Inherits [baseline deployment controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#deployment-and-configuration).

## Capacity, scaling, cost, and sustainability

Inherits [baseline capacity controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#capacity-and-overload).

## Failure, recovery, and compatibility

Inherits [baseline reliability controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#reliability-and-compatibility); local extensions remain normative.

## Observability, testing, and operational readiness

Inherits [baseline evidence controls](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence).

## Standards and implementation strategy

Follows adopt, extend, fork, then build ([ADR-0001](../architecture/architecture-decision-records/ADR-0001-standards-first-buy-borrow-build.md)).

## Settled architecture constraints

The accepted constraints are the ADRs listed below and the precedence rules in [Architecture Authority and Precedence](../architecture/Architecture-Authority-and-Precedence.md).

## Decision traceability

- ADR-0001: Standards-First / Buy-Borrow-Build
- ADR-0005: Standard Platform Primitives
- ADR-0012: Tenant-Neutral Post-Secondary Digital Commons
- ADR-0013: Institution-First Federation Locality
- ADR-0016: Accepted Project Defaults
- ADR-0017: OpenTofu Default Infrastructure-as-Code Toolchain

## Acceptance criteria

Inherits [baseline acceptance gates](../architecture/Cross-Cutting-Architecture-Requirements.md#observability-and-evidence); every local requirement MUST also pass.
